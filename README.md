This README file is the results for the Assignment 5 which are generated by the code share.py, each commit of this file corresponds to the solution for Task1, Task2 and Task3 respectivly. 

#Task1:

In Task 1, we first load in the following point cloud from dataset1.npy:
<img width="449" height="402" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79d5e458-1a76-41ed-8162-c28a10eb16fa" />

By looking at a histogram of the hight of each point, it seen that the lower parts is way more represented than the other values, this is due to that ground, which several of the points comes from. This histogram can be seen here 
<img width="583" height="426" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6bc1add-fee1-4211-885a-8ee96eef562b" />

Removeing the two lowest bars the following point cloud remains:

This assumed a ground level of the most prominent pixel value + 1, which corresponded to a pixel value of 61.6 for the hight. 

Doing the same plots for dataset2.npy gives first without filtering ground:

after ground have been filtered by removeing the most previlent value + 1:

#Task 2:

For this task we follow https://machinelearningknowledge.ai/tutorial-for-dbscan-clustering-in-python-sklearn/ to get the optimal value for DBSCAN, at first we have this classification for the data dataset1.npy:
<img width="894" height="888" alt="bild" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebb4b1ce-c4e0-491d-b3e0-613d79ea14f1" />

after we do a elbow plot and find the elbow, the optimal value for DBSCAN's cluster radius, which ends up beeing: 0.45991955803735224

<img width="558" height="571" alt="bild" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d064d145-9753-4624-b9bc-cfa05efe63b5" />

The resulting classification looks as follows:
<img width="906" height="921" alt="bild" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28fb89be-e0c4-4807-9cf5-f4bac7676a7a" />

for the otherdataset, dataset2.npy we  at first get the following result from DBSCAN:
<img width="886" height="917" alt="bild" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3014c87a-f7be-4b7f-816d-3703fce44fb4" />

We do an elbow plot and get an optimal value as 0.5259980993096163 for the DBSCAN's cluster radius, shown in the image below:
<img width="545" height="557" alt="bild" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24b07687-de91-4127-bfa8-4715f549f6a7" />


The resulting classification then looks like this:
<img width="894" height="918" alt="bild" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5369830c-6577-4e1a-90d1-83f9539e8d70" />

#Task 3

Here we are to look at the largest clusters. For dataset1.npy we get the following:
<img width="496" height="360" alt="bild" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/037dddfd-eaee-4d25-8021-a8699b6d881a" />
  <div class="coords">
min x= 10.51699999999255
max x= 21.521000000007916
min y= 80.04000000003725
max y= 95.09800000023097
 </div>
this does not look like anyting we are after, the second most populated class does:
<img width="495" height="356" alt="bild" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89b3b3e0-54ac-4c5a-ae69-864fd2f751a2" />
  <div class="coords">
min x= 27.23200000001816
max x= 49.12599999998929
min y= 82.26200000010431
max y= 139.15000000037253
 </div>


We get forest as the most populates class in dataset2:

<img width="365" height="359" alt="bild" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb2b9d93-c500-4384-8e3f-2a5f09d06f29" />
  <div class="coords">
min x= 49.46300000001793
max x= 55.312999999994645
min y= 63.26699999999255
max y= 76.09700000006706
 </div>
however if we take the fifth most populated class we get something that looks reasonable:

<img width="392" height="346" alt="bild" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9662206f-3fbe-4f70-8dd9-a08117a82a36" />
  <div class="coords">
min x= 0.0
max x= 69.80100000000675
min y= 0.0030000004917383194
max y= 79.98699999973178
 </div>
