This README file is the results for the Assignment 5 which are generated by the code share.py, each commit of this file corresponds to the solution for Task1, Task2 and Task3 respectivly. 

In Task 1, we first load in the following point cloud:
<img width="449" height="402" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79d5e458-1a76-41ed-8162-c28a10eb16fa" />

By looking at a histogram of the hight of each point, it seen that the lower parts is way more represented than the other values, this is due to that ground, which several of the points comes from. This histogram can be seen here 
<img width="583" height="426" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6bc1add-fee1-4211-885a-8ee96eef562b" />

Removeing the two lowest bars the following point cloud remains:
<img width="476" height="385" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5af1dc23-1880-4cbf-975e-d36cb4f769a2" />

This assumed a ground level of the minimum pixel value + 2, which corresponded to a pixel value of 61.6 for the hight.
