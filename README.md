This README file is the results for the Assignment 5 which are generated by the code share.py, each commit of this file corresponds to the solution for Task1, Task2 and Task3 respectivly. 

TASK1:

In Task 1, we first load in the following point cloud from dataset1.npy:

By looking at a histogram of the hight of each point, it seen that the lower parts is way more represented than the other values, this is due to that ground, which several of the points comes from. This histogram can be seen here

Removeing the two lowest bars the following point cloud remains:

This assumed a ground level of the most prominent pixel value + 1, which corresponded to a pixel value of 61.6 for the hight. 

Doing the same plots for dataset2.npy gives first without filtering ground:

after ground have been filtered by removeing the most previlent value + 1:
